## How to contribute?

Follow the steps:
* Create a directory where you'd like to store the project. Preferably name the directory **Project-01**.
* Open a **terminal**.
    > On Windows, press windows+r to open run prompt and then type **"cmd"** (without the quotes). It should open up a terminal.
    
    > For Linux users the shortcut is Ctrl+Alt+T and for MAC users I have no idea.

* Then type this command in terminal (replace the placeholder path with the absolute path of your directory that we created in first step.)

    `cd path_to_the_folder`

* Then run this command in terminal
    > Note: you must have **git** installed on your system, check the installation steps [here](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
