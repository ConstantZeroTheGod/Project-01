## ABOUT

Project-01 is a project instantiated by @WitteDuivel (Vivek Chakravorty).

This projects aims to simulate a working universe from the very beginnings. But there is a twist, I am sure no one among you has a *SUPER COMPUTER* and neither do I. That's why this universe is a text based universe.

Meaning? That every event, every detail will only be by text, absolutely no imagery. If you want someone to visualize something, use text!

As previously mentioned this universe is a simulation of a real universe, it will have it's own Science, it's own mathematics, galaxies, planets etc.

Let your imagination be wild and free!!

Your contribution is very much appreciated and I insist on you doing so! No matter how small it is. Write your story and tell everyone!
